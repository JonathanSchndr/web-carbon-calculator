# GitHub Issue Templates - Usage Instructions

## What Was Created

I've created 5 comprehensive feature request templates in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory. While I cannot create GitHub issues directly, these templates will make it extremely easy for you or anyone else to create the issues with just a few clicks.

## The 5 Feature Templates

### 1. 🏆 Global Leaderboard & Ranking System

**Key Ideas:**
- Public leaderboard with top/worst performers

- User submission system
- Social sharing of rankings

### 2. 🧠 Dynamic Recommendations Engine  
**Template:** `feature-dynamic-recommendations.md`

Intelligent, personalized recommendations that go beyond the current static suggestions.

**Key Ideas:**
- Detailed analysis of images, scripts, fonts, caching

- Shows estimated CO2 savings for each recommendation
- Implementation guides with code examples
- Interactive checklist to track progress

### 3. 📈 Historical Tracking & Trends
**Template:** `feature-historical-tracking.md`

Track website carbon footprint over time and visualize improvement trends.

**Key Ideas:**

### 4. ⚖️ Multi-Website Comparison Tool
**Template:** `feature-comparison-tool.md`

Compare multiple websites side-by-side (2-10 at once).

**Key Ideas:**
- Batch analysis of multiple URLs
- Side-by-side table and chart views

- Shareable comparison URLs
- Perfect for competitor analysis

### 5. 🏅 Embeddable Badge & Widget Generator
**Template:** `feature-badge-generator.md`

Generate badges and widgets that websites can embed to showcase their carbon scores.

**Key Ideas:**
- Shield-style badges (like shields.io)
- Multiple styles and formats (SVG, PNG)
- Dynamic widgets with mini dashboards
- Verification system to prevent spoofing
- Customization interface with live preview
- Viral growth potential (badges link back)

## Template Structure

Each template includes:

✅ **Feature Description** - Overview of what the feature does

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Ready for Contributors** - Anyone can pick up an issue and start working
